# API Cheatsheet 
This is the API Cheat sheet. In this cheat sheet, we'll show you some basics on how to call and consume 3rd party APIs for your project

## Getting Started
This Cheat sheet will refer to the [Pokemon API, or PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) for it's examples

## Testing an API 
To test APIs, in most cases, you can simply call them in your browser.

Try, for example, [https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/1](https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/1). This API call will fetch the results for Bulbasaur! It may be overwhelming when you get this response, as it will likely be a large wall of JSON, but don't worry, executing the same call in [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) will auto collapse all the field to make it more manageable

## JSON 
Most API responses will return some structure in JSON. This is pretty commonplace amongst the industry, and JSON can be easily navigated with libraries or natively in most languages. [Go here to learn more about JSON](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_intro.asp)
