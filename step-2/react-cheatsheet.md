# React Cheatsheet
## Getting Started
It's important to make sure you have installed Node & NPM when working with React. Both can be installed by downloading Node from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

As a general note of practice, it's best to download the LTS version, as most libraries will take time to update to the latest version.
## Creating a project
To create a new React project (with typescript)
```
npx create-react-app --template=typescript project
```

To create a new React project without typescript
```
npx create-react-app step-2
```

## Running a project
To run a project once it's completely ready:
```
npm run start
```

## Updating dependencies
When installing 3rd party packages (such as Material-UI or Redux), it's important to install new node packages with the following command 
```
npm install
```
